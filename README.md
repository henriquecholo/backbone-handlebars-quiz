backbone-handlebars-quiz
========================

Quiz made using BackboneJS, RequireJS and Handlebars

This quiz is different then the backbone-quiz. I'm still using Backbone, Underscore and RequireJS libraries, but I'm also using other things, such as Yeoman, Grunt, Handlebars, Bootstrap Sass, npm and bower.

Speaking in npm and bower, to run the application you need to first get all the folders and files, then install NodeJs.

After that you can just simply do those commands on terminal:

Installing the node_modules folder

npm install -g

Installing bower dependencies

bower install -g

Building grunt

grunt build

Running the Grunt Server

grunt server

If you face any problems, you might need to also install ruby and compass in the better way on your machine:

http://compass-style.org/install/

Let me know if you were able to run the application. Thank you :D
